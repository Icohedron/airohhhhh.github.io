					<br>

					 	Summoner has a pretty straightforward tree. Most of Summoner’s skills benefit your ability to do damage 
						with your pet in one way or another or provide useful utility,
                        which doesn’t leave you with much room to invest in skills that don't.
                        <br><br>
                        Recommended skill trees for both the Japanese and <span class="highlightna">North American</span> servers can be found at the end of this page, but I’d recommend 
                        reading the following explanations on why certain skills are or aren’t used first.
                        <br><br><br>
                        
                        
            <!-- Required Summoner Skills -->

                    <div class="bggrey rounded">
                        <span class="highlightrequired bold">Required Skills</span>:<br><br>

                        <!-- Dear Master/Dia Master -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/dearmaster.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Dear Master. NA: Dia Master">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Dear Master/<span class="highlightna bold">Dia Master</span></span> (5 SP) - </span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">When taking damage that would kill you, 
                        your pet receives the damage instead.</span> 
                        This skill allows you to completely disregard your character’s health, 
                        which means you can spend your time dealing damage with your pet instead of healing yourself. 
                        The only time you’ll die through Dear Master is if you and 
                        your pet are both killed by the same attack - your killing blow cannot be 
                        redirected to your pet if your pet is dead. Keep the pet alive, and you won’t die.

                        <br><br>

                        <!-- Pet Sympathy -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/petsympathy.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Pet Sympathy">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Pet Sympathy</span> (10 SP) - </span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">Allows your pets to request Shifta and Resta casts. 
                        When you cast Shifta at your pet’s request, your pet gains a +20% damage buff. 
                        When you cast Resta at your pet’s request, your pet gains a 200% HP recovery buff. 
                        These buffs last 90s.</span> 

                        Simply cast the technique your pet requests and it will gain a damage/HP recovery buff. 
                        Make sure to take the time to meet your pets’ requests as it 
						can sometimes take your pet a while to request again. Meeting a Pet Sympathy request
						while it's already active will refresh the buff.<br>
						<div class="center">
							
                            <img src="../images/skill tree/wanda_shiftasympathy.png" class=" rounded plusmargin paddingleft"  width="263" height="201" alt="Wanda requesting Shifta Sympathy"> 
                        
                            <img src="../images/skill tree/wanda_restasympathy.png" class=" rounded plusmargin" width="263" height="201" alt="Wanda requesting Resta Sympathy">
                        
							<img src="../images/skill tree/wanda_sympathymet.png"  class=" rounded plusmargin" width="263" height="201" alt="Wanda after you've met its Sympathy request"><br>
							
						</div>
						As a note, pets are more likely to request Shifta Sympathy while around bosses and typically request Resta Sympathy when they're low on HP.
						
						<br><br>
                       
                        <!-- Assist Share -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/assistshare.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Assist Share">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Assist Share</span> (1 SP) - </span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">When switching pets, any buffs such as 
						Pet Sympathy, Shifta, and Deband will be automatically transferred from your 
						current pet to the next.
						</span> 

						Without this skill you would lose Pet Sympathy when switching pets, 
						and you would need to reapply Shifta every time you switch pets. 
						Extremely important skill for the cost of just 1 SP.

						<br><br>
					   
						<!-- Point Assist/Summoner's Mark -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/pointassist.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Point Assist. NA: Summoner's Mark">
						<span class="bold"><span class="underline">Point Assist/<span class="highlightna bold">Summoner's Mark</span></span> (10 SP)</span><span class="semibold">, Active Skill </span><span class="bold">-</span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">Places a marker on an enemy. 
						Damage dealt to the marked point by you and your pets is 
						increased by 15%. Marker lasts 40s. 5s cooldown. 
						</span> 

						This is generally not worth your time against crowds of enemies due 
						to the opportunity cost that comes with casting Point Assist. 
						If you choose to cast this every time you walk up to a crowd in a 
						mobbing quest, that’s a lot of time you’re spending not dealing 
						damage just to mark one enemy. However, it’s an amazing single 
						target damage tool, so it’s absolutely worth investing in.

						<br><br>

						<!-- Support Fire/Enhanced Mark -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/enhancedmark.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Support Fire. NA: Enhanced Mark">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Support Fire/<span class="highlightna bold">Enhanced Mark</span></span> (1 SP) - </span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">Increases damage dealt to a Point Assist-marked enemy by 10%. 
						</span> 
						With the addition of Support Fire, you will deal a total of +25% damage 
						to the marked point and +10% damage to anywhere else on the enemy.

						<br><br>
					   
						<!-- Alter Ego -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/alterego.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Alter Ego">
						<span class="bold"><span class="underline">Alter Ego</span> (10 SP)</span><span class="semibold">, Active Skill </span><span class="bold">-</span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">For 60 seconds, your pet deals 20% more damage, 
						however, 80% of damage dealt to your pet is also received by you. Has a 30s cooldown.
						</span> 

						Taking that much extra damage might sound harsh, but +20% damage is <span class="italic">massive</span>, 
						so this skill is mandatory. That said, Summoner’s level 85 Skill, 
						Alter Ego Harmony, makes this much more manageable. 
						Don’t be afraid to take this skill and use it often!

						<br><br>

						<!-- Alter Ego Harmony -->
                        <img src="../images/skill tree/alteregoharmony.png" class="imgfloatleft"  alt="Alter Ego Harmony">
						<span class="bold"><span class="underline">Alter Ego Harmony</span> (0 SP)</span><span class="semibold">, Requires Level 85 </span><span class="bold">-</span>

                        <span class="highlightgreen semibold">While Alter Ego is active, 
						damage dealt to you or your pet is reduced by 80%. Additionally, 
						you gain Super Armour and are immune to status effects.
						</span> 

						This skill significantly reduces the damage you and your pets take 
						and makes you immune to nearly all stuns, 
						knockdowns, and displacements while Alter Ego is ennabled. Always take this skill.

						<span class="highlightna semibold">This skill is currently not available on the NA servers.

			<!-- Recommended Summoner Skills -->

					<div class="bggrey rounded">
                        <span class="highlightrecommended bold">Recommended Skills</span>:<br><br>

						<!-- Harmonize Up -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/sympathyskillgeneral.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Harmonize Up">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Harmonize Up</span> (5 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">Increase the chance of your pet requesting
						Pet Sympathy by 300%.
						</span>

						Not having Shifta Sympathy hurts your damage a lot and this skill lessens the chance of that happening.

						<br><br>

						<!-- Sympathy Time -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/sympathyskillgeneral.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Sympathy Time">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Sympathy Time</span> (5 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">Extend the duration of Pet Sympathy by 200%.
						</span>

						Losing Shifta Sympathy sucks. Probably makes your pet feel pretty unloved as well.
						Well, it'll be fine. You'll take this skill and prevent that, because you're not an awful person.

						<br><br>

						<!-- Easy Sympathy -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/sympathyskillgeneral.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Easy Sympathy">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Easy Sympathy</span> (1 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">Extend the acceptance window of Pet Sympathy requests by 10s.
						</span>

						This allows you to put off activating pet Sympathy for a little while 
						if you’re busy doing something else in combat, such as fighting an enemy during it's knockdown phase, 
						where you really don't wanna lose out on damage just 'cause your pet chose a bad time to ask you for buffs.
						This is a nice utility to have and it's only 1 SP, so why not?

						<br><br>

						<!-- Long Distance Love -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/longdistancelove.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Long Distance Love">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Long Distance Love</span> (1 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">Gain the ability to meet Pet Sympathy requests from a distance.
						</span>

						Being able to meet your pets' requests without taking the time to recall them is pretty nice.
						Less time wasted moving the pet in and out of combat means more time for your pet to fuck enemies up.

						<br><br>

						<!-- Pet Element Weak Hit/Pet Elemental Precision Hit -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/petelementweakhit.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Pet Element Weak Hit. NA: Pet Elemental Precision Hit">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Pet Element Weak Hit/<span class="highlightna bold">Pet Elemental Precision Hit</span></span> (5 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">When your pet’s attribute matches the enemy’s weak attribute, 
						increase your pet’s damage by 10%.
						</span>

						While using a light attribute pet, this skill won’t always be active, 
						but it’ll be active most of the time. Definitely a skill that's worth investing in.
						<br><br>
						This skill is a big part of the reason why it's important that your pets are Light element - 
						tons of enemies are Light weak, and you definitely want +10% damage against them.
						<br><br>
						You can also invest in a type of candy called Ramunes, 
						which allow you to change your pet’s attribute prior to starting a quest (or even mid quest) 
						by slotting a 1x1 candy into its candy box, in turn allowing you to make use of this 
						skill even against enemies that aren't weak to Light.

						<br><br>

						<!-- Pet Element PP Restorate/Pet Elemental PP Restorate -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/petelementpprestorate.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Pet Element PP Restorate. NA: Pet Elemental PP Restorate">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">Pet Element PP Restorate/<span class="highlightna bold">Pet Elemental PP Restorate</span></span> (5 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">When your pet’s attribute matches the enemy’s weak attribute, 
						increase the PP recovery of your pets’ normal attacks by 50%.
						</span>

						Same deal as Pet Element Weak Hit. This is often active with a Light pet, and you can 
						switch your pet’s attribute to make use of this skill more often than that if you wish. 

						<br><br>

						<!-- PP Up 1 & 2 -->
						<img src="../images/skill tree/ppup.png" class="imgfloatleft" alt="Pet Element PP Restorate. NA: Pet Elemental PP Restorate">
                        <span class="bold"><span class="underline">PP Up 1 & 2<span class=" bold"></span></span> (5 & 10 SP) - </span>

						<span class="highlightblue semibold">Increases your PP by up to 15.
						</span>

						If you’ve invested in all other skill points that interest you and 
						still have skill points left over, this is a good place to invest them. 
						Interacts well with Critical Stream on Phantom subclass.
