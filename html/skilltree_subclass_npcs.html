                        Summoner has a pretty straightforward tree. 
                        Most of Summoner’s skills benefit your ability to do damage 
						with your pet in one way or another or provide useful utility,
                        which doesn’t leave you with much room to invest in the skills that don't.
                        <br><br>
						Recommended skill trees for both the Japanese and North American servers can be found at 
						<a class="highlight underline" href="https://arks-layer.com/classbuilds">https://arks-layer.com/classbuilds</a>, but I’d recommend reading the following explanations on why certain skills are or aren’t used first.

                                    This skill is crucial to Summoner gameplay because by default, your character has no
                                    defensive mechanisms outside of dodging. No invincibility frames, guard frames, nothing.
                                    Investing into this skill allows you to be unburdened with caring about your character's health bar,
                                    which leaves you much more time to focus on your pet in combat.

                                    These buffs last 90s.</span> 

                                    Simply cast the technique your pet requests and it will gain a damage/HP recovery buff. 
                                    Make sure to take the time to meet your pets’ requests as it 
                                    can sometimes take your pet a while to request again. Meeting a Pet Sympathy request
                                    while it's already active will refresh the buff.

                                    As a note, pets are more likely to request Shifta Sympathy while around bosses and typically request Resta Sympathy when they're low on HP.

                                    <span class="text-success semibold">When switching pets, any buffs such as 
                                    Pet Sympathy, Shifta, and Deband will be automatically transferred from your 
                                    current pet to the next.
                                    </span> 

                                    Without this skill you would lose Pet Sympathy when switching pets, 
                                    and you would need to reapply Shifta every time you switch pets. 
                                    Extremely important skill for the cost of just 1 SP.

                                    Not having Shifta Sympathy hurts your damage a lot, so this skill is worth investing in to prevent that as much as possible.

                                    Same idea as Harmonize Up. Losing Shifta Sympathy sucks, and it probably makes your pet feel pretty unloved as well.
                                    Take this skill to prevent that.

                                    This allows you to put off activating pet Sympathy for a little while 
                                    if you’re busy doing something else in combat, such as fighting an enemy during it's knockdown phase, 
                                    where you really don't want to lose out on damage just 'cause your pet chose a bad time to ask you for buffs.<br><br>

                                    A nice utility that's definitely worth 1 SP.

                                    Being able to meet your pets' requests without taking the time to recall them is pretty nice.
                                    Less time wasted moving the pet in and out of combat means more time for your pet to fuck enemies up.

                                    Much of PSO2's enemies are weak to Light, making this a relatively consistent 10% damage increase so long

                                    into your pet's candy box. Changing your element on the fly like this isn't required, but it is an option
                                    if you wanna swap your pet's element for a quest or boss that isn't weak to Light.

                                    Same deal as Pet Element Weak Hit. This is often active with a Light pet, and you can 
                                    switch your pet’s attribute to make use of this skill more often than that if you wish.<br><br>

                                    PP efficiency can be problematic on some pets, so it's very much recommended that you take this skill.

                                    This skill is crucial to Summoner gameplay because by default, your character has no
                                    defensive mechanisms outside of dodging. No invincibility frames, guard frames, nothing.
                                    Investing into this skill allows you to be unburdened with caring about your character's health bar,
                                    which leaves you much more time to focus on your pet in combat.

                                    Simply cast the technique your pet requests and it will gain a damage/HP recovery buff.

                                    can sometimes take your pet a while to request again. Meeting a Pet Sympathy request
                                    while it's already active will refresh the buff.

                                    As a note, pets are more likely to request Shifta Sympathy while around bosses and typically request Resta Sympathy when they're low on HP.

                                    </span>

                                    This allows you to put off activating pet Sympathy for a little while 
                                    if you’re busy doing something else in combat, such as fighting an enemy during it's knockdown phase, 
                                    where you really don't want to lose out on damage just 'cause your pet chose a bad time to ask you for buffs.<br><br>

                                    A nice utility that's definitely worth 1 SP.

                                    Being able to meet your pets' requests without taking the time to recall them is pretty nice.
                                    Less time wasted moving the pet in and out of combat means more time for your pet to fuck enemies up.

                                    Much of PSO2's enemies are weak to Light, making this a relatively consistent 10% damage increase so long

                                    which allow you to change your pet’s attribute on the fly by slotting a 1x1 Candy
                                    into your pet's candy box. Changing your element on the fly like this isn't required, but it is an option
                                    if you wanna swap your pet's element for a quest or boss that isn't weak to Light.

                                    Same deal as Pet Element Weak Hit. This is often active with a Light pet, and you can 
                                    switch your pet’s attribute to make use of this skill more often than that if you wish.<br><br>

                                    PP efficiency can be problematic on some pets, so it's very much recommended that you take this skill.
